# Ansible

* Ansible is a simple, open-source, configuration managemnet tool used for IT. 

* It is a **push based** configuration management tool.

* Ansible does not require an agent on a remote/target host to perform any operation. Minimum requirement is that the **host machine should have python installed on it**.

* Ansible is agentless in nature, which means we don't need to install any software on the manage nodes.
